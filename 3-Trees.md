# Trees
Trees are similar to linked lists in that they have nodes that point to eachother. the difference comes in how they point to eachother. Where a linked list forms a continuous line each node only pointing to the item before and after it, a tree can point to numerous nodes, and often doesn't point back. 

## Tree Basics
with trees you have a root. From that root you can get to any other node in the tree. 
Below is an example of a tree

You can see in the tree that there is a parent and child nodes. Any node that points to another is the parent to the other and the one it points to is a child to it.
