# Queues
{basic explaination of module}


## Basics of Queueing
Queuing is essentially setting up a list of items to address. Depending on the type of queue items will be processed in order. Each item will be QUEUED, and DEQUEUED

## Examples of Queue
There are 3 examples of queues we will be covering in this tutorial; Grocery store queue, web server queue, and the reader/writer queue.

### Grocery Store Queue
This is probrably what most people think of with queues. The first item in the queue will be the first one to be used, just like a grocery store. The first person in line is the first person served. One iteme will be QUEUED at a time and one will be DEQUEUED.

### Web Server Queue
this queue is similar to grocery store queue in that the first item QUEUED, will be the first item DEQUEUED. Unlike a grocery store queue, this web server queue uses an intermediary to decide which items to queue first. like with a phone line, if you call you will be connected, but if someone calls 911, their call will take priority.

### Reader/Writer Queue
Unlike a web server, or grocery store queues, this reader/writer queue is built to handle multiple items at the same time. By juggling the processes it seems like it is working on all of them at the same time

## Queues With Python
In python queues are often done through a list.

to enqueue you might .apprnd to a list
to Dequeue you might .pop from the list

these are some examples to help you get used to queues with python
