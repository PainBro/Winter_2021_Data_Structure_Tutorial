# Linked Lists

Linked lists are an important data structure that are often used in projects. This tutorial will help to teach you about linked lists and how to use them.


## Basic Lists

The basic list is categorized by a specific portion of data set apart for the list. Often with larger lists it can be hard to add or remove from the middle or even the front. 
Basic lists also are limited to the size you specify in the begining. Although these often work well, there are times when you will need something else.

## Linked Lists

a linked list uses a pointer system, each value points to the value before it and the value after it. This makes it so that it is easier to add and remove from any position. It also makes it so that the list can always be added to because there is no set length.
